     <p><strong>HOME AUTOMATION USING ARDUINO UNO AND BLUETOOTH</strong></p>
     <em>IN COLLEGE PROJECT</em>
     <p>The main objective of this project is to develop a Home Automation System using Android mobile with Bluetooth Module. Nowadays people are expecting to control the home appliances through remote control. This expectation is fulfilled by our advanced technology. In this article we are using Bluetooth and Android OS to develop a smart home. Modern Houses are expected to have centralized control system, instead of conventional switches which are fitted on walls. If the user wants to control the appliances, they have to move near the wall and control the switches. This method is inconvenient for the elderly and disabled people. So their difficulty to operate the appliances can be supported by the proposed home automation system which has a remote module to control the appliances. Remote controlled home automation system fulfills the  needs of the people. Remote control operation is achieved by a smart phone or Tablet which is supported by Android OS. In the smart phone Android App with Bluetooth acts as a transmitter, which sends commands to the receiver Bluetooth module. In this  article  ARDUINO  UNO  controller  board  which  contains  an  Atmega328p  IC  is  used.  The  loads  are interfaced to the Arduino controller using Electromagnetic Relays.
